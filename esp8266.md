### Connecting to ESP8266 via Arduino IDE

**Description**  
ESP8266 is a highly integrated chip designed for the needs of a new connected world. It offers a complete and self-contained networking solution, allowing it to either host the application or to offload from another application processor.

**Instructions**
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE.
2. Set up your Arduino IDE as:  
Go to File > Preferences and copy the URL below to get the ESP board manager extensions: arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
3. Go to Tools > Board > Board Manager > Type "esp8266" and download the Community esp8266 and install.
4. Set up your chip as:  
Tools > Board > NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module) Tools > Flash Size > 4M (3M SPIFFS)   
Tools > CPU Frequency > 80 Mhz Tools > Upload Speed > 921600   
Tools > Port > (whatever it is)
5. Download and run the 32 bit flasher exe at Github (Search for nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/ at Github) `github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/Win32/Release` Or download and run the 64 bit flasher exe at: `github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher/tree/master/Win64/Release`
